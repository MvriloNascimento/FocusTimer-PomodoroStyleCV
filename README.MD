## ðŸ’» Project

Focus Timer with the possibility of adjusting the time. The timer will have the option to select the desired sound, as well as its volume. Functions like volume control and dark-mode are included in it. As the project gives us the freedom to add something else to the project, I decided to make the project inspired by the album "Bonda 3" by the artist MC VV, you will be able to find these references during the project cards.
